Updates
~~~~~~~
.2018-12-1
Several improvements to the transients of »Reedy« (since the Version used for LAC).
Needs some further work to smooth them out, but overall, the voice now approaches
completion.

.2019-1-6
Adjustment to go with the LFO-Fix provided by Yoshimi 1.5.10.
As it turns out, only »Reedy« got significant fine-tuning to the LFO-Phase
during the time where Yoshimi contained the Bug for Frequency-LFO, and thus needs
to be ported in order to behave equivalent. For context, Yoshimi 1.5.1 through 1.5.9
started the Frequency-LFO with maximal positive offset (like a cosine), while it would
be correct to start it with 0 and ascending (like a sine).
The resulting differences can be audible, especially when interacting with the initial
transient of a voice; yet typically the change is quite subtle and only obvious in
direct comparison.
